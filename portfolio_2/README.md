# Radiation Exposure Analysis
## Overview
Welcome to the Radiation Exposure Analysis project! This Python script allows you to analyze radiation exposure levels at different locations. It includes predefined data for various locations, such as the city center, industrial zone, residential district, rural outskirts, and downtown.

# Usage
The script begins with existing data for locations and their corresponding radiation levels.
You have the option to input new data for a location, providing radiation readings.
Enter the radiation levels for the new location one by one. Type 'done' when finished.
The script calculates and displays the average and standard deviation of radiation levels for each location.
